  "content": "We all heard about Blockchain and know that it acts like a decentralised database that records all the transactions. And it's impossible to tamper with the records as all the transactions are chained together, which means to tamper with one transaction, one has to do that to all the chained blocks stored on all the nodes across the world within the Blockchain network, in other words that's a mission impossible. That's nice and dandy but how does Blockchain authenticate the transactions? How does the Blockchain know the person who sends the request is really who they claim to be?\n\nLet's look at the following scenario to understand how Blockchain technology verifies user's authenticity.\n\n## How does Blockchain know the sender is who they claim to be?\n\nLet's say Sarah wants to send $10 to her friend Steve. In this case the message would be about a transaction to transfer a $10 fund to the recipient Steve. Before the Blockchain network makes the transaction happen, it needs to know if the request is legit. Basically the Blockchain needs to verify that the person is really Sarah, not some random dude sitting in a basement pretending to be Sarah? The answer is the Blockchain verifies the digital signature that's signed by the sender.\n\n![Blockchain authentication](/images/blog/how-does-blockchain-authenticate-transactions/step1.jpeg)\n\n## The message is signed using the private key that's only owned by the sender\n\n**Note:** To be more technically correct, it's actually the hash of the message (not the original message) that's been signed by a temporary private key (cryptographically generated), not the actual private key, which adds one more layer of security to ensure that the actual private key canâ€™t be calculated by attackers watching signed transactions on the Blockchain network.\n\nBasically the network receives the message that's signed by the private key that's only owned by the sender to confirm that \"***only the owner of the private key that generated this public key could have produced this signature on this transaction.***\" The network then verifies the signature and decides to process the message or rejects it.\n\n## But how is the digital signature good enough for the Blockchain network to trust the message?\n\nIf you understand the process of verifying the signature, then you will understand how a simple digital signature is good enough for the Blockchain to trust the message.\n\n![](/images/uploads/step2.jpeg)"

  "content": "We all heard about Blockchain and know that it acts like a decentralised database that records all the transactions. And it's impossible to tamper with the records as all the transactions are chained together, which means to tamper with one transaction, one has to do that to all the chained blocks stored on all the nodes across the world within the Blockchain network, in other words that's a mission impossible. That's nice and dandy but how does Blockchain authenticate the transactions? How does the Blockchain know the person who sends the request is really who they claim to be?\n\nLet's look at the following scenario to understand how Blockchain technology verifies user's authenticity.\n\n## Step 1 - Sarah sends a request to the Blockchain to transfer $10 to Steve\n\nLet's say Sarah wants to send $10 to her friend Steve. Before the Blockchain network makes the transaction happen, it needs to know if the request is legit. Basically the Blockchain needs to verify that the person is really Sarah, not some random dude sitting in a basement pretending to be Sarah.\n\n![Blockchain authentication](/images/blog/how-does-blockchain-authenticate-transactions/step1.jpeg)\n\n## Step 2 - The Blockchain verifies the user via digital signatures\n\nYou might be wondering... what is digital signature? Digital signature doesn't look even close like the traditional signature but serves similar purpose - proving the ownership of the message, except it's a LOT harder to tamper with a digital signature.\n\n#### What does a digital signature look like?\n\nShort answer: something not readable by a human. Technical answer: A digital signature is nothing but a mathematical scheme (a stream of code) that the computer uses to do the following three things:\n\n* Verify the sender of the message\n* Guarantee the proof of authorisation, which means the sender cannot deny the authorisation. \n* Verify that the transaction data has not been and *cannot be modified* by anyone after the transaction has been signed.\n\nIn other words, a valid digital signature gives the recipient the reason to believe that the request was created by a verified sender, and the sender cannot deny having sent the request, and last but not least the message was not changed during the transit."
